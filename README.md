## Requirements

You only need Docker to be installed on your machine.

## Launching the project

    docker-compose up -d

## Accessing the project
    
        http://localhost:8080

## Notes

After all the containers are up and running, please wait 120s before you can access the project on http://localhost:8080, as cassandra, and kafka need some time to start up.
